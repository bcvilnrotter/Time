# Time
A python pygame project that I created one weekend instead of studying for a midterm during graduate school. My goal for
putting this in the public domain is to give anyone a jumpstart into any pygame programming project they might be
interested in, and ultimately help me strengthen my github game for future project using this project as a springboard.

At the time I wanted to learn game coding using python, but wanted to test out features that I thought would be fun without
having a cohesive idea of what my endgame goal was for the project. In the years that followed I added a couple more ideas,
and eventually stopped progress entirely. I often find myself yearning for a game that grows a world on its own, while
the player gives gentle nudges here and there to tell a narrative story through the "growth" of isometric tiles. With the
way this project was built I think there is still potential for it to blossom into something that could be used later
(despite pygame libraries being obsolete), but as of now I plan to use this repo for reference and inspiration.

Please take with this as you will, and let me know if I can be of assistance in any way.
